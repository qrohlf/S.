# Eric

Some seriously interesting parallels between Eric's life and that of S. on `43`

Died once (`55`)??

Very religious family (`93`).

Lots of references to accusations of insanity, and allusions to a critical and possibly bad event in Eric's life that is associated with water and boats...

*okay, this event gets explained pretty conclusively on `202.5`. Also on `202.5`: Eric's real name is "Nicodemus John Husch"

Deep cut on leg happens in tunnels - referenced in red ink on `231`.
