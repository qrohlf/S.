# Footnote Codes

## Foreword
Not sure if the foreword includes a footnote code, but it seems likely.

### Theory - section #'s correspond with words:
Section 1 - 'Who'  
Section 2 - 'I'  
Section 3 - 'it'  
Section 4 - 'in'  
Section 5 - 'some'  
Section 6 - 'ever'  

*conclusion: wrong theory*

### Possible FN code clues:
- FN 2 has a specific date, but there's no evidence to support it. *Le Monde* is a Parisian evening newspaper. 

## Chapter 1
The chapter one footnote code is discovered by Jennifer on `29`. The first and last letters of each footnote combine to give the following:

> AR GO SY EV ER Y 19th 1900  H RS

Given the existience of an Argosy Hotel on E. 38th Street in NY, this likely is FXC trying to indicate to Straka that she'd be waiting there to meet him on the 19th of each month at 7pm (1900 hrs). 

## Chapter 2
Jennifer again solves FN code - Playfair Cipher (`42`). The key is "Gemini", which gives the following:

> "Looper Agent"

The chapter title is what hints at "Gemini" - this is the first overt indication that the footnote code is related to chapter titles.

Might be worth looking into the Playfair Cipher to see if there might be anything that Jennifer missed.

## Chapter 3
FN code revealed by Jennifer on `80` - letters on either side of 's':

> ARP IS BOUCHARD IS HW

HW presumably refers to Horst Wechsler (`80`). ARP refers to a company (what kind?) whose first chairman was A. R. Prinsen who worked for Bouchard and was a manager at the Calais factory (`91`).

## Chapter 4
Code is words after 'ex' words (`122`):

> AVOID GRAND CENTRAL
> KEY STOLEN
> ASSUME BAG GONE
> I FAILED

## Chapter 5
"every page, every line, every word" (`167`) is key to painted cave number matrix code on `184`. Gives:

> WILL WAIT TEN YEARS THEN HOME

## Chapter 6
FN code is "Nihlist" cipher (`205`) solved by Jen on `236`:

> MAC WAS JUDAS NOT TIAGO

## Chapter 7

Letter matrix on `263` uses a "running key" keyed to the word "impenetrable" in the Baltimore obituary. Gives:

> Sum losing hope. Please get in touch.

I.e. Summersby isn't Straka (`263`).

Also: Eötvös wheel likely needed to decode part of chapter (`270`).

## Interlude

## Chapter 8

The footnotes in this chapter have some letters which are typeset with a slightly higher baseline compared to the rest of the footnote. Here's a table of them:

FN # | Marked Letters
--- | ---
2  | HVA
3  | AEVHY
4  | EROY
5  | EU
6  | OHE
7  | UVE
8  | EUECV
9  | ORE
10 | BGA
11 | RAIHSG
12 | VC
13 | TNE
14 | AOINE
15 | PKA
16 | SP
17 | NNLE
18 | IYED
19 |
20 | OETN

This is revealed by Jennifer to be a rail-fence cipher with 19 rails on `373`. Deciphered, it reads:

> HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED   
> THINKING ABOUT HER   
> HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN   
> ANYONE ELSE A CHANCE   

## Chapter 9

FN #1  - the only footnote - occurs on `388`, but marginalia suggests there is no code... Chapter title is "birds of Negative Space". Could be read as an indication that there is no code in the chapter, or alternatively that the code is encoded in the "negative space" of the chapter. 



# Eötvös Wheel Codes

The E. Wheel is first mentioned on `3`, as the key to decoding the puzzles in *Coriolis*. Apparently it needs a reference latitude to work.
