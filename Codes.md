# Footnote Codes

# Chapter 1
The chapter one code is discovered by Jennifer on `29`. The first and last letters of each footnote combine to give the following:

> AR GO SY EV ER Y 19th 1900  H RS

Given the existience of an Argosy Hotel on E. 38th Street in NY, this likely is FXC trying to indicate to Straka that she'd be waiting there to meet him on the 19th of each month at 7pm (1900 hrs). 

# Chapter 2
Jennifer again - Playfair Cipher (`42`). The key is "Gemini", which gives the following:

> "Looper Agent"

The chapter title is what hints at "Gemini" - this is the first overt indication that the footnote code is related to chapter titles.

# Eötvös Wheel Codes

The E. Wheel is first mentioned on `3`, as the key to decoding the puzzles in *Coriolis*. Apparently it needs a reference latitude to work.

# Number Codes?

Strangely specific number in the footnote on `45`
